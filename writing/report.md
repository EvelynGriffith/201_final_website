# Allegheny College Role-playing and Gaming Organization (ARGO) Club Website

## Report by Pallas Cain and Evelyn Griffith

## Design of your project

TODO: include a diagram

## Implementation of your project

TODO: include information about technical details of your project, including all tools and programming languages used.
Our website includes languags such as JavaScript, SCSS, Nunjucks, Python, and a small amount of HTML. We are using the platform Netlify to help produce our website. We started with a Netlify template but had to customize and personalize to fit our goals. We customized aspects such as the website icon, main image, the information on the board members and the club, and event articles. Parts we had to impliment ourselves included a new page for the name generator itself. We also added a page with important club links such as the Google Drive.

## Evaluation and Testing of your Program

TODO: include program input and output and output of test cases in code blocks

## Description of the challenges that you faced and how you resolved them

TODO

## If worked in a team, description of the way in which you and your team members shared the project workload

We split the workload in half when it came to customization and we made design choices as a team. All the photos and information on the club came directly from Pallas since she is the president. Evelyn worked a lot with making the different page structures work and adding the website's functionalites. Pallas made the AI that generated the names. Both of us had to work together to figure out how to get the Python program onto the website without it breaking. Pallas also worked on testing the website and making the diagram. We both worked on de-bugging the website.
