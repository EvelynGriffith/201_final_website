Design of your project
TODO: include a diagram

Implementation of your project
TODO: include information about technical details of your project, including all tools and programming languages used.
Our website includes languags such as JavaScript, SCSS, Nunjucks, Python, and a small amount of HTML. We are using the platform Netlify to help produce our website. We started with a Netlify template but had to customize and personalize to fit our goals. We customized aspects such as the website icon, main image, the information on the board members and the club, and event articles. Parts we had to impliment ourselves included a new page for the name generator itself. We also added a page with important club links such as the Google Drive.
