### Humans VS. Zombies

Join ARGO for our annual tradition of saving the world from a Halloween zombie invasion. The brave students must solve the campus wide puzzle before the zombies catch them and then they themselves become part of the invasion! Which team will win? Who knows if we will all survive.
