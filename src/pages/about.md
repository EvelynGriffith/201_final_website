## What is ARGO?

The Allegheny Gaming and Role-Playing Organization (ARGO) gives students a place to play board games, organize role-playing games, and meet other students with similar interests. This includes hosting weekly board game nights and scheduling frequent tabletop game-oriented events. Anyone is welcome and is great for those with any interest in Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, or any other form of tabletop/role-play gaming.
